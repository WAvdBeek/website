# Introduction



IoTivity is an open source framework that implements the [OCF](https://openconnectivity.org) (Open Connectivity Foundation) protocol for easy, secure device-to-device communication for IoT devices. IoTivity includes the following:



- A reference implementation of **client software** -- the OTGC (Onboarding Tool and Generic Client) app for controlling a smart home or other IoT device (available on Linux or Android)

- A reference implementation of **server software** that runs on the actual IoT device

- **Tools that generate code** for the server, based on a JSON file that you will create to describe your deviceâ€™s capabilities
